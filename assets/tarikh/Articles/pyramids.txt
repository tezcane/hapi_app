A __pyramid__ is a structure, usually of stone, built in the shape of a pyramid. From ancient to modern times people in many different parts of the world have built such structures.

The first __pyramids__ were built in 2630 B.C. The oldest known pyramid is in Saqqara, Egypt and was built by King Djoser of the Third Egyptian dynasty.

The Quran talks much about the Egyptian dynasty's in the stories about Musa (AS, Moses) and Yusuf (AS, Joseph).

The Quran accurately describes Egyptian history by referring to the leader of these Egyptian dynasties as a king or a pharaoh (which came later).  A historical fact that was only recently discovered by British Museum.  According to them, the Egyptians did not call their rulers ‘Pharaoh’ until the 18th Dynasty (1552 - 1295 BC).

A few verses talking about Musa and Firaun (the Pharaoh):
__"We (Allah) rehearse unto thee a portion of the story of Moses and Pharaoh with truth, for the benefit of a people who would believe. (Quran 28:04).
"We sent Moses with Our Signs to Pharaoh and his chiefs, but they unjustly rejected them. Behold, then, what was the end of those who created
disorder! (Quran 7:104)
"This day shall We save you (O Pharaoh) in your body, that you may be a Sign to those who come after you! But indeed, many among mankind are
neglectful of Our Signs. (Quran 10:93)__

It is widely accepted by historians, Christians and Muslims that the Pharaoh Ramesses II was the Pharoah mentioned in the Quran and Old Testament that Musa interacted with.

The Quran's prophecy of __"This day shall We save you (O Pharaoh) in your body, that you may be a Sign to those who come after you!"__ is not found in any other scripture and even historians had no clue of this until recently.  The mummified bodies of all the Pharaohs lay concealed in the Valley of Kings (KV7 & 8) along the banks of the Nile.  Even after their tombs were plundered, the mummified remains of the pharaohs were kept their undiscovered for centuries. Their discovery took place in the 19th century and you can now see, Ramesses II with your own eyes in the Egyptian Museum of Cairo, or at one of their international tours of Ramesses II.  Thus, another Quranic miracle showing how the Quran can only have come from God as these verses were revealed to mankind over 1400 years ago.
