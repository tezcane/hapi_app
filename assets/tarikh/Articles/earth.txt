__Earth__ and the other planets formed about 4.6 billion years ago. They were made of the leftover gas from the nebula that made the Sun. This is again a scientific miracle of the Quran as God explains it in the Quran: "Then He (Allah) turned to the heaven while it was all smoke. He said to the heaven and the earth: “Come (into being), willingly or unwillingly.” They said: “Here we come (into being) in willing obeisance.”  This verse was speaking about how the Earth was formed.

The Moon may have been formed after a collision between the early __Earth__ and a smaller planet (sometimes called Theia). Scientists believe that parts of both planets broke off — becoming (by gravity) the Moon.

The Quran states that Allah created the sun, the moon, and the planets, each with their own individual courses or orbits. __"It is He Who created the night and the day, and the sun and the moon; all (the celestial bodies) swim along, each in its rounded course" (Quran 21:33).__

__Earth__'s water came from different places. Condensing water vapour, and comets and asteroids hitting __Earth__, made the oceans. Within a billion years (that is at about 3.6 billion years ago) scientists believe first life started, in the Archaean era. Some bacteria developed photosynthesis, which lets plants make food from the Sun's light and water. This released a lot of oxygen, which was first taken up by iron in solution. Eventually, free oxygen got into the atmosphere or air, making __Earth__'s surface suitable for aerobic life. This oxygen also formed the ozone layer which protects __Earth__'s surface from bad ultraviolet radiation from the Sun.

Again, God tells us about the ozone layer in the Quran, yet another scientific miracle of the Quran: __"And We have made the sky a well-protected canopy, still they turn away from its signs." (Quran 21:32)__

Scientists believe complex life on the surface of the land did not exist before the ozone layer because without it's protection the Sun's radiation would be too much for advanced life to survive.

__Earth__ was very different in the distant past. Long ago, almost all land was in one place. This is called a supercontinent. The earliest known supercontinent was called Vaalbara. Much later, there was a time (the Cryogenian) when __Earth__ was almost entirely covered by thick ice sheets (glaciers). This is called the Snowball __Earth__ theory.
