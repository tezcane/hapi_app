__Constantinople__ was the capital of the Roman Empire (330-395), the Byzantine/East Roman Empire (395-1204 and 1261-1453), the Latin Empire (1204-1261), and the Ottoman Empire (1453-1922). In 1930 it was renamed Istanbul. It is a city in present-day Turkey.

The conquest of Istanbul, also known as Islambol, was yet another sign and proof of Islam as the Prophet Muhammad had prophesized it. __“Verily, you shall conquer Constantinople. What a wonderful army will that army be, and what a wonderful commander will that conqueror be.” (Musnad, I, 176; IV, 335; Darimi, “Muqaddima”, p. 43).__  This is a great honor for the Ottomans who conquered the city in 1453 and had one of the longest reigning and most powerful empires in history.

Historians have stated that, for the time period conquering __Constantinople__ is equivalent to conquering a place like New York city today.
