__Apollo 11__ was the first flight to send people to the moon. It was done by NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration), the original American space agency. It went up to space on July 16, 1969, carrying three astronauts: Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins. On July 20, 1969, Armstrong and Aldrin became the first humans to land on the moon, while Collins stayed in orbit around the Moon.

The flight was part of the __Space Race__ between the United States and the Soviet Union. It finished the plan set by John F. Kennedy, the Unite States 35th president, in 1961 to "land a man on the moon, and return him safely to the Earth", before the 1960s ended.
