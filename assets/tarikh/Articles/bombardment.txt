The Late Heavy Bombardment (abbreviated LHB and also known as the Lunar Cataclysm) is an event thought to have occurred approximately 3.8 to 4.1 billion years ago.  This is known as the Neohadean and Eoarchean eras on Earth. During this interval, a disproportionately large number of asteroids are theorized to have collided with the early terrestrial planets in the inner Solar System, including Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars.

The Late Heavy Bombardment happened after the Earth and other rocky planets had formed and accreted most of their mass, but still quite early in Earth's history.

Scientists believe that this is how most of the heavy metals and objects came to Earth.  They believe this because, based on the Earth's size, they know that such materials could not naturally have developed here.  They therefore attribute these metals coming here through various meteor showers.

Again, the Quran confirm this modern scientific finding in the Quran, which was revealed 1400 years ago.  God tells us, "We have already sent Our messengers with clear evidences and sent down with them the Scripture and the balance that the people may maintain [their affairs] in justice. And We sent down iron, wherein is great military might and benefits for the people, and so that Allāh may make evident those who support Him and His messengers unseen. Indeed, Allāh is Powerful and Exalted in Might." (Quran 57:25)

Until recently, this verse about "we sent down iron" would not have made much sense, but it turns out the Quran is quite literal in describing how metals got on Earth.
