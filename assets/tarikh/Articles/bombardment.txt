__"We have already sent Our messengers with clear evidences and sent down with them the Scripture and the balance that the people may maintain [their affairs] in justice. And We sent down iron, wherein is great military might and benefits for the people, and so that Allāh may make evident those who support Him and His messengers unseen. Indeed, Allāh is Powerful and Exalted in Might." (Quran 57:25)__

The Late Heavy Bombardment (abbreviated LHB and also known as the Lunar Cataclysm) is an event thought to have occurred approximately 3.8 to 4.1 billion years ago.  This is known as the Neohadean and Eoarchean eras on Earth. During this interval, a disproportionately large number of asteroids are theorized to have collided with the early terrestrial planets in the inner Solar System, including Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars.

The Late Heavy Bombardment happened after the Earth and other rocky planets had formed and accreted most of their mass, but still quite early in Earth's history.

Today scientists know that iron could not have developed on Earth. Due to the Earth's size they know, they know that such materials could not naturally have developed here.  In fact, they know that iron must be made inside stars, specifically red super-giants.  Only inside such a gigantic star can elements form together during fusion reactions.  Then a supernova occurs, meaning the star explodes, and iron fragments are blasted into space.  Scientists believe this is how iron came to Earth, millions of years ago.

The Quran mentions, __"And We sent down iron"__.  Until recently, without scientists knowing about the __Heavy Bombardment__ period, this verse about __"we sent down iron"__ would not have made much sense to us.  However, it turns out God quite literally had iron sent down to us so we can benefit from it.
