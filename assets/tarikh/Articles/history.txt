__History__ is the study of past events. People know what happened in the past by looking at things from the past including sources (like books, newspapers, and letters) and artifacts (like pottery, tools, and human or animal remains.) Libraries, archives, and museums collect and keep these things for people to study history. A person who studies history is called a historian. A person who studies pre-history and history through things left behind by ancient cultures is called an archaeologist. A person who studies mankind and society is called an anthropologist. The study of the sources and methods used to study and write history is called historiography.

People can learn about the past by talking to people who remember things that happened in the past. This is called oral history. When people who had been slaves and American Civil War survivors got old, some historians recorded everything that they said, so that history would not be lost.

The same was done in Islamic history.  Much was written down, but there were several scholars that went around collecting every last saying of the Prophet (Hadith) into books.  A whole Islamic science was developed on top of this to verify the chains of narrations leading back to the Prophet (SAW) and to rank these hadiths into soundness classification levels.  We know who all these people and their families were, they are not just random first names in a book (i.e. Mark, Luke, John).  Often, the same hadith can be found dozens of times in the same book or spread out over several books of hadith as it was collected by so many people.  This would be classified as a Sahih (very sound) hadith.

The Quran was also written down but mostly memorized by thousands of people during the life of the Prophet SAW.  It is still memorized by Millions of people today, in the original Arabic language- even by non-Arabic speakers.  This is possible because the Quran is poetic and easy to remember for many people. If all the text of the Quran somehow vanished, the Muslims could bring it back in a few seconds if they worked together.  It is not needed anyway, as God told us he will protect it in the Quran. __“Indeed, it is We who sent down the Qur’an and indeed, We will be its guardian.” (Quran 15:9)__

Regardless of it's poetic and recitation beauty the Quran's message fits easily in the mind of the believers because it explains the past, future and present in a logical and easy to understand way.  The Quran is actually the biggest miracle we have, and only one we need, to prove Islam is the true religion.  Got created us and talks to us and teaches us directly with the words of the Quran.  And who is better to teach us then God, the one that created us and knows us best?

In old times people in different parts of the world kept separate histories because they did not meet each other very often. Some groups of people never met each other. Medieval Europe, Ancient Rome and Ancient China each thought that they ruled the only important parts of the world and that other parts were "barbarian".
