__The Roman Empire__ (Latin: Imperium Romanum) was the largest empire of the ancient world. Its capital was Rome, and its empire was based in the Mediterranean. The Empire dates from 27 BC, when Octavian became the Emperor, Augustus, till it fell in 476 AD, marking the end of the Ancient World and the beginning of the Middle Ages, or Dark Ages.

The empire was the third stage of Ancient Rome. Rome was first ruled by Roman kings, then by the Roman Republic, then by an emperor.

Many modern lands were once part of the __Roman Empire__, including Britain (not Scotland), Spain, Portugal, France (Gaul), Italy, Greece, Turkey, Germany, Egypt, Levant, Crimea, Switzerland,and the north coast of Africa. The main language of the __Roman Empire__ was Latin; Greek was an important secondary language.

The western part of the __Roman Empire__ continued for about 500 years, and the eastern part, including Greece and Anatolia, continued for about a thousand years more. The eastern part was called the Byzantine Empire, its capital being Constantinople and was ended by the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople in 1453 by Sultan Fatih Mehmet.  This event was prophesized by the Prophet Muhammad and is one of the most notable events in world history.
