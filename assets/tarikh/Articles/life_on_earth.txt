The earliest claimed lifeforms are fossilized microorganisms (or microfossils). They were found in iron and silica-rich rocks which were once hydrothermal vents in the Nuvvuagittuq greenstone belt of Quebec, Canada.

These rocks are as old as 4.28 billion years. The tubular forms they contain are shown in a report. If this is the oldest record of life on Earth, it suggests "an almost instantaneous emergence of life" after oceans formed 4.4 billion years ago. According to Stephen Blair Hedges, "If life arose relatively quickly on Earth then it could be common in the universe".

The Qur'an describes that Allah __"made from water every living thing" (Quran 21:30).__ Another verse describes how __"Allah has created every animal from water. Of them are some that creep on their bellies, some that walk on two legs, and some that walk on four. Allah creates what He wills, for truly Allah has power over all things" (24:45).__

These verses support the scientific theory that life began in the Earth's oceans.  They also go along with modern biology that state that some animals are made up of up to 90% water, while humans are made up of about 60% water.
