__The Black Death__ was an outbreak of disease that killed millions of people across Europe and Asia. Almost one out of every three people in Europe died from the disease, and was at its worst between 1347 and 1351. The disease may have started in Asia. Most people think that the disease was the bubonic plague. This disease is carried and spread by fleas living on rats. Traders from the Silk Road may have brought the infected fleas to Europe.

Fleas started the problem; the infected fleas were carried by black rats. Rats that were carrying the fleas would go into cities. When the fleas bit somebody, they would inject a little bit of the bacteria into the wound. This would cause the person to be infected. Rats were often on ships. This meant the disease spread extremely quickly, all over Europe.

In humans, the disease caused swelling in the groin, under the arms and behind the ears. These swellings were a black and purple colour, hence the name 'The Black Death'. The dark swellings were called buboes. People were in pain and victims died a horrible death. The symptoms could be seen 3â€“7 days after victims were bitten by a flea carrying the disease.

Sadly, in some cities like in London it was thought that cats caused the disease so they were hunted and killed in great numbers.  Unfortunately, as to be expected, this caused the plague to get worse as now the rats lost their main natural predator and there populations grew even greater.

Another interesting fact around the bubonic plague is how the Pope saved himself.  At the time, the Muslims were at the head of all medical and scientific discovery.  Combing through many Muslim books, the Catholic clergy discovered that fire was thought to ward off and kill certain sicknesses (germs).  As such, they lit an enormous fire in a circle surrounding the Pope which lasted several weeks.  This of course, kept rats and their flees away form the Pope and he survived without any problems.
