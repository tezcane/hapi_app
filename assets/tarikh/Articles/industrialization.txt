__Industrialization__ (or Industrialisation) is a process that happens in countries when they start to use machines to do work that was once done by people. __Industrialization__ changes the things people do. __Industrialization__ caused towns to grow larger. Many people left farming to take higher paid jobs in factories in towns.

__Industrialization__ is part of a process where people adopt easier and cheaper ways to make things. Using better technology, it becomes possible to produce more goods in a shorter amount of time. More things can be produced by fewer people.

After industrialization people also do more specialized jobs. For example before industrialization, a cobbler (a person who makes shoes and leather goods) made a pair of shoes all alone. He worked on one pair of shoes, finished it, then would start on the next pair of shoes. With industrialization, there are many people involved in making shoes by cutting the shoe making process into smaller tasks.  For example, there is one person that cuts the sole of the shoe and another person stitches it. In short, there is division of labour and it is known as an assembly line today. The machines in such factories cost a lot of money, so the factory will be owned by a rich person who can afford the machines and hires workers to man the different machines and tasks.

__Industrialization__ started in England with the industrial revolution in the 18th century. It spread first to parts of Europe, and to North America. In the 20th century industrialization spread to most other countries.
