Bipedalism is having or using two feet to walk. Scientists believe bipedalism in primates arouse 6 to 7 million years ago since this is the earliest fossils they have found that show bipedalism traits.  Evolutionists believe these to be early ancestors of the human species, but this theory has little evidence to support it.
