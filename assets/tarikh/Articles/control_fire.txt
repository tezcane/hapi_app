__The control of fire__ by early humans was very important to early humans. Fire provided a source of warmth, protection, improvement on hunting and a method for cooking food. These cultural advancements allowed for cultural innovations and changes to diet. Additionally, controlling fire allowed the expansion of human activity into colder climates and to stay up later in the evening, by both providing warmth and light.

Claims for the earliest definitive evidence of control range from about 200 thousand to 1.7 million years ago. Evidence for the controlled use of fire beginning some 1,000,000 years ago, has wide scientific support. Flint blades burned in fires were found near human fossils in Morocco and dated to about 300 thousand years ago. Widespread evidence of control of fire dates to approximately 125,000 years ago.
