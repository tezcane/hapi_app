 __"Do the disbelievers not realize that the heavens and earth were once one mass then We clove them asunder? And We created from water every living thing. Will they not then believe?" (Quran 21:30)__

The __Big Bang__ model is that the universe begun in an extremely dense and hot condition and has expanded. The theory suggests, and measurements show, that the universe is still expanding today.

The __Big Bang__ is a scientific theory about how the universe started, and then made the stars and galaxies we see today.

The universe began as a very hot, small, and dense superforce (the mix of the four fundamental forces), with no stars, atoms, form, or structure (called a "singularity"). Then about 13.8 billion years ago, space expanded very quickly (thus the name "__Big Bang__"). This started the formation of atoms, which eventually led to the formation of stars and galaxies. It was Georges Lema√Ætre who first noted (in 1927) that an expanding universe could be traced back in time to an originating single point.

However, unknown to many a lot of modern astronomical and other scientific facts, like the big bang, planet formation, orbits and behavior, embryology and much more, was revealed to us by God in the Quran over 1400 years ago. For example, Georges Lemeaitre was not the first to note about the Big Bang.  The Qur'an clearly talks about the Big Bang __"Do the disbelievers not realize that the heavens and earth were once one mass then We clove them asunder? And We created from water every living thing. Will they not then believe?" (Quran 21:30)__

If you are looking for a sign or proof of God, know this is just one of the many countless proofs that Islam is God's true and only religion.

The universe is still expanding today, which was recently discovered.  However, again the Quran confirms: __"The heavens, We have built them with power. And verily, We are expanding it" (Quran 51:47)__.

As a whole, the universe is growing and the temperature is falling as time passes. Cosmology is the study of how the universe began and its development. Scientists who study cosmology agree that the __Big Bang__ theory matches what they have observed so far.

Fred Hoyle called the theory the "__Big Bang__" on his radio show. He did not believe the __Big Bang__ was correct. Scientists who did not agree with him thought the name was funny and decided to use it.

Scientists base the __Big Bang__ theory on many different observations. The most important is the redshift of very far away galaxies. Redshift is the Doppler effect occurring in light and also observable in sound (the sound a racecar makes as it approaches vs. when it is moving away from you- "Vrrrrrrrrrr" (towards you) "oooooooommmmm" (moving away from you). Similarly, when an object moves away from Earth, its color rays look more similar to the color red than they actually are, because the movement stretches the wavelength of light given off by the object. Scientists use the word "red hot" to describe this stretched light wave because red is the longest wavelength on the visible spectrum. The more redshift there is, the faster the object is moving away. By measuring the redshift, scientists proved that the universe is expanding, and they can work out how fast the object is moving away from the Earth. With very exact observation and measurements, scientists believe that the universe was a singularity approximately 13.8 billion years ago. Because most things become colder as they expand, scientists assume that the universe was very small and very hot when it started.

Other observations that support the __Big Bang__ theory are the amounts of chemical elements in the universe. Amounts of very light elements, such as hydrogen, helium, and lithium seem to agree with the theory of the __Big Bang__. Scientists also have found "cosmic microwaves background radiation". This radiation is known as radio waves, and they are everywhere in the universe. This radiation is now very weak and cold, but a long time ago it was very strong and very hot.

Some scientists and philosophers argue that time had no meaning before the __Big Bang__. They argue that the __Big Bang__ was the beginning of time, and there was no universe before the __Big Bang__, since there could not be any "before" if there was no time! As Muslims, we know God is Everlasting and beyond anything our mind can comprehend.  As such, it makes perfect sense why we cannot grasp the concept of time before the big bang, this is one of the many paradoxes that point to an All-Powerful Creator.

For arguments sake, let us say we can explain what was before the Big Bang or exactly how it was created even.  Then the next question would be, "Well then, what created that?".  And say we explained what created that too, then again, the question would remain, "Well, what created that?".  As you can probably see, this would never end so it is actually a great evidence of God being our sole creator and how the concept of God is far outside our limited human intellect.

Muslims do not debate on such matters, we just accept what God tells us about Himself and His creation.  For example, God speaks of his hands but we know they are unlike any hand we know.  A human has hands, a monkey has hands, a clock has hands.  God's hands are beyond anything we can imagine, and we leave it at that.
