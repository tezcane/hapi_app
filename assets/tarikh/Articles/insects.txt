__Insects__, are a class in the phylum Arthropoda. They are small terrestrial invertebrates which have a hard exoskeleton.

__Insects__ are the largest group of animals on earth by far. About __926,400 different species__ have been described. They account for __more than half of all known living species__ and are believed to __make up over 90% of animal species__on Earth.

New species of __insects__ are continually being found. Estimates of the total number of species range from 2 million to 30 million.

__Insects__ have six legs; and most have wings. __Insects__ are believed to be the first animals capable of flight. As they develop from eggs, __insects__ undergo __metamorphosis__, an amazing process of transformation where an immature form of an insect changes to an adult form in two or more distinct stages. __Insects__ live all over the planet: almost all are terrestrial (live on land), but some live __insects__ in the oceans or in very cold places, such as Antarctica. Most species live in tropical areas.

Some people call all __insects__ "bugs", but this is not correct. Only some __insects__ are true bugs, which is a particular order of __insects__. People who study __insects__ are called __entomologists__.
