__The Cold War__ (1947â€“1991) was the tense relationship between the United States (and its allies), and the Soviet Union (the USSR and its allies) between the end of World War II and the demise of the Soviet Union.

Most of the countries on one side were allied in NATO whose two largest military countries were the United States and Turkey. Most of the countries on the other side were allied in the Warsaw Pact most powerful country was the Soviet Union (now Russia).

The Western-Capitalist group of countries includes the Americas, Turkey, Western Europe, Israel, Japan, South Korea, Thailand, Iran (1945-1979), Pakistan, Malaysia, Philippines, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand.

The Eastern-Socialist group includes Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, Angola, Ethiopia, Cuba (1959-1991), Mongolia, North Korea, China and Vietnam.

The Cold War ended with the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, with Russia changing from from a socialist communist country to a democratic capitalist country.  However, there is still remaining conflict here as seen in the recent battles and war between Russia and Ukraine.
