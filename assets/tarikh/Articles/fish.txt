Scientists believe the first fish appeared around 530 million years ago during the Cambrian explosion. They are believed to be the first vertebrates, or animals with a backbone or spinal column.  The first fish are thought to belong to the Agnatha, or jawless fish. During the late Cambrian, eel-like jawless fish called the conodonts, and small mostly armoured fish known as ostracoderms, first appeared. Most jawless fish are now extinct.
